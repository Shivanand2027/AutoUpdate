# Simple Calculator App

## About

This repository hosts a simple, interactive calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and a clear, user-friendly interface.

This project was created to demonstrate fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic application logic in JavaScript, structured with a class-based approach.

## Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Clear & Delete:** Clear all input or delete the last digit.
*   **Keyboard Support:** Operate the calculator using your keyboard for numbers, operators, Enter (equals), Backspace (delete), and Escape (clear).
*   **Modern Design:** Styled with CSS for a clean and visually appealing interface.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** For structuring the calculator layout with display and buttons.
*   **CSS:** For styling the calculator grid, buttons, and output display for a modern look.
*   **JavaScript:** Implements the core calculator logic using a class, handling number input, operations, clear, delete, computation, and display updates, including keyboard support.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoUpdate.git
    cd AutoUpdate
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The calculator will be immediately accessible.

## Future Enhancements (Planned Improvements)

*   Implement more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, percentage, trigonometry).
*   Improve error handling for edge cases like division by zero.
*   Enhance UI/UX with themes or more sophisticated animations.
*   Add unit tests for the calculator logic.
