# AutoUpdate

A new repository

## About

This repository aims to provide a robust and flexible solution for managing automatic updates in applications or systems. Whether you're building a desktop application, a command-line tool, or a server-side component, AutoUpdate intends to simplify the process of keeping your software up-to-date for your users.

## Features (Planned)

*   **Automatic background updates:** Seamlessly download and apply updates without user intervention.
*   **Manual update checks:** Allow users to check for and initiate updates on demand.
*   **Version management:** Keep track of current and available versions.
*   **Rollback mechanism:** Provide options to revert to a previous stable version in case of issues.
*   **Configurable update sources:** Support various methods for fetching updates (e.g., HTTP, local files, custom APIs).
*   **Cross-platform compatibility:** Design for use across different operating systems.
